One of the most common cybersecurity problems is broken access control. According to OWASP Top 10 "94% of applications were tested for some form of broken access control with the average incidence rate of 3.81%. Notable Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) were: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorised Actor, Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Sent Data and Cross-Site Request Forgery."

Considering our application, some privacy permissions should be implemented:

Guest users should not be able to edit anybody's data

Only users from "administrators" or "managers" group should be able to delete or change  user's accounts or data

Users from "agents" group should only be able to create or edit only their own data
